# QUIZZ CAPITAL CITIES (IN FRENCH)

## DESCRIPTION 

A small game in Python, guess the capital cities of all countries. 3 difficulty levels and records are saved.

I decided to learn Python. This small program is the result of my first day of learning. I only believe in learning by doing so here it goes (the code is quite messy but hey, it works).

The game is in French only. I might add a english version later upon request.

The goal of the game is to guess correctly capital cities of world countries.

It should work on all systems, as long as you have a python interpreter.


### 2 Game Mode :
- Guess the Capital city of the country
- Guess the Country from the capital city

### 3 Difficulty Level :
- Easy : No time limit, 3 Jokers, When the answer is wrong the game give you the right answer so you can improve
- Medium : No time limit, 1 Joker, Answers are given at the end of a set.
- Hard : 120 seconds time limit, 0 Joker, No Hint.

### High Scores :
- All high scores depend on the game mode and the difficulty level, so there can be a total of 6 different high scores
- High scores are stored in a file "records_quizz_capitales.txt" in the current folder

Code is not optimized at all and feedback for improvement is welcome

## Possible improvements :
- Better UI for better visibility
- Categories by continents
- Add other game modes
